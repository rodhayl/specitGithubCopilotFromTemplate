# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the agent interaction flow in the VSCode Docu extension. Currently, users execute commands like `@docu /new "Card Game Shop"` but receive no clear guidance on how to interact with different agents, what questions agents should ask, or how to progress through workflows. The system needs proactive agent behavior, clear instructions, and logical workflow progression.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want agents to proactively ask relevant questions when I create a new document, so that I can provide the necessary information to develop comprehensive documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new document THEN the active agent SHALL immediately ask 3-4 strategic questions relevant to their specialization
2. WHEN the PRD Creator agent is active THEN it SHALL ask about problem definition, target users, solution approach, and success criteria
3. WHEN the Brainstormer agent is active THEN it SHALL ask exploratory questions about concepts, variations, opportunities, and challenges
4. WHEN the Requirements Gatherer agent is active THEN it SHALL ask about functional needs, user roles, acceptance criteria, and constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear instructions on how to interact with agents after document creation, so that I understand what actions I can take next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is created successfully THEN the system SHALL display available interaction options
2. WHEN displaying interaction options THEN the system SHALL show agent-specific commands and capabilities
3. WHEN showing next steps THEN the system SHALL include workflow progression suggestions
4. IF multiple agents are available THEN the system SHALL explain how to switch between agents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want agents to provide contextual follow-up questions based on my responses, so that I can have a natural conversation that builds comprehensive documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user responds to agent questions THEN the agent SHALL analyze the response and ask relevant follow-up questions
2. WHEN follow-up questions are asked THEN they SHALL build upon previous answers to deepen understanding
3. WHEN sufficient information is gathered THEN the agent SHALL suggest moving to the next workflow phase
4. IF the user provides incomplete information THEN the agent SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want agents to automatically capture and structure information from our conversation, so that documentation is built incrementally without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users provide information through conversation THEN agents SHALL automatically update the relevant document sections
2. WHEN information is captured THEN it SHALL be formatted according to the document type (PRD, requirements, etc.)
3. WHEN documents are updated THEN users SHALL be notified of what sections were modified
4. IF conflicting information is provided THEN the agent SHALL ask for clarification before updating

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear workflow progression guidance, so that I know when to move between different agents and phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow phase is complete THEN the system SHALL suggest the next logical phase and agent
2. WHEN suggesting phase transitions THEN the system SHALL explain what will happen in the next phase
3. WHEN users are ready to transition THEN the system SHALL provide clear commands to switch agents
4. IF prerequisites are missing THEN the system SHALL identify what needs to be completed first

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want agents to provide examples and templates for responses, so that I can understand what type of information is expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents ask questions THEN they SHALL provide examples of good responses when helpful
2. WHEN requesting specific formats THEN agents SHALL show template structures
3. WHEN users seem confused THEN agents SHALL offer alternative ways to phrase questions
4. IF users provide unclear responses THEN agents SHALL suggest more specific formats

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my progress through the documentation workflow, so that I understand how much work remains and what has been accomplished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users request status THEN the system SHALL show current phase, completed sections, and next steps
2. WHEN displaying progress THEN it SHALL include percentage completion and estimated remaining work
3. WHEN showing workflow status THEN it SHALL highlight any missing or incomplete sections
4. IF users want to review previous work THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to completed documents

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want agents to validate and review information before finalizing documents, so that I can ensure quality and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document section is complete THEN the agent SHALL review it for completeness and quality
2. WHEN reviewing content THEN the agent SHALL identify gaps, inconsistencies, or improvement opportunities
3. WHEN validation issues are found THEN the agent SHALL ask specific questions to resolve them
4. IF content meets quality standards THEN the agent SHALL confirm completion and suggest next steps
