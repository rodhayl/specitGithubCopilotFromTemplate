# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the build and test failures in the VS Code extension project. The project currently has compilation errors and test failures that prevent successful packaging and testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to compile successfully, so that I can package and distribute the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run compile` THEN the TypeScript compilation SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN running `npm run package` THEN the extension SHALL be packaged successfully into a .vsix file
3. IF there are type errors THEN they SHALL be resolved while maintaining backward compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass, so that I can ensure the code quality and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN all test suites SHALL pass without failures
2. WHEN tests reference missing methods or properties THEN those methods SHALL be implemented or mocked appropriately
3. IF test interfaces don't match implementation THEN the interfaces SHALL be aligned

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent interfaces across the codebase, so that components can interact properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components reference TemplateManager THEN it SHALL be available and properly exported
2. WHEN tests expect certain interface properties THEN those properties SHALL exist in the actual interfaces
3. IF there are missing methods in classes THEN they SHALL be implemented with appropriate functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling, so that the application can gracefully handle failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error handling decorators are used THEN they SHALL be compatible with the method signatures
2. WHEN error objects are passed to handlers THEN they SHALL conform to the expected Error interface
3. IF async operations fail THEN proper error handling SHALL be in place
