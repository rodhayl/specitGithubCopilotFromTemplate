# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Docu extension has two critical usability issues that break the conversation flow and document updating workflow. First, after users execute agent setup commands like `/agent set prd-creator` or document creation commands like `/new`, they must manually type `/chat` to continue conversations, creating friction in the user experience. Second, when users engage in conversations with agents (like the PRD creator), their responses and the agent's guidance are not being written back to the actual document files, making the conversations ineffective for document creation. This spec addresses these workflow interruptions to create a seamless user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Docu extension, I want the system to automatically transition to chat mode after setting an agent so that I can immediately start conversing without typing additional commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes `/agent set <agent-name>` THEN the system SHALL automatically enable chat mode for that agent
2. WHEN chat mode is enabled after agent setup THEN the system SHALL display a prompt indicating the user can now chat directly
3. WHEN a user types a message after agent setup THEN the system SHALL route it directly to the active agent without requiring `/chat`
4. WHEN the auto-chat mode is active THEN the system SHALL show clear indicators that the agent is ready for conversation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically transition to chat mode after creating a document with conversation flags so that I can immediately start developing the document content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes `/new "Document Title" --with-conversation` THEN the system SHALL automatically enable chat mode
2. WHEN a document is created with conversation enabled THEN the system SHALL start the appropriate agent conversation automatically
3. WHEN auto-chat is enabled after document creation THEN subsequent user messages SHALL be routed to the conversation without `/chat`
4. WHEN the document creation conversation starts THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which agent is active and ready

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer creating PRDs and other documents, I want my conversation responses to be automatically written to the document file so that the document is built progressively through our conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user responds to agent questions during document creation THEN the system SHALL update the document file with relevant content
2. WHEN an agent processes user responses THEN the system SHALL extract structured information and write it to appropriate document sections
3. WHEN document updates occur during conversation THEN the system SHALL preserve existing content and add new information appropriately
4. WHEN a conversation session completes THEN the document SHALL contain all the information gathered during the conversation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visual feedback about the current conversation state so that I understand when I can chat directly versus when I need to use commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-chat mode is active THEN the system SHALL display clear indicators showing the active agent and conversation state
2. WHEN a user can chat directly THEN the system SHALL show prompts like "ðŸ’¬ Ready for your input" or similar
3. WHEN conversation mode changes THEN the system SHALL notify the user about the new state
4. WHEN multiple conversation sessions exist THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which session is active

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the document updating to work intelligently so that conversation content is organized properly in the document structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent conversations generate content THEN the system SHALL map responses to appropriate document sections based on the template structure
2. WHEN updating document sections THEN the system SHALL maintain proper markdown formatting and document hierarchy
3. WHEN multiple conversation turns occur THEN the system SHALL accumulate information and update sections progressively
4. WHEN document templates have placeholders THEN the system SHALL replace placeholders with conversation-derived content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the auto-chat functionality to work consistently across all agent types and document templates so that the experience is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent is set via `/agent set` THEN the auto-chat behavior SHALL be consistent regardless of agent type
2. WHEN any document is created with conversation flags THEN the auto-chat behavior SHALL work with all supported templates
3. WHEN switching between agents during active conversations THEN the system SHALL handle the transition smoothly
4. WHEN offline mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior for auto-chat functionality
