# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Docu VS Code extension currently suffers from critical architectural issues that are causing non-meaningful messages and duplicated code throughout the codebase. After 15+ failed attempts at quick fixes, we need a systematic approach to eliminate all code duplication and fix the messaging system to provide meaningful user feedback. This is a high-priority fix to prevent team consequences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Code Deduplication

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all duplicated code completely removed so that there is only one implementation of each feature and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the conversation management system THEN there SHALL be only one ConversationManager implementation
2. WHEN analyzing the output coordination system THEN there SHALL be only one OutputCoordinator implementation  
3. WHEN analyzing the feedback coordination system THEN there SHALL be only one FeedbackCoordinator implementation
4. WHEN analyzing command handlers THEN there SHALL be no duplicate command handling logic
5. WHEN analyzing template services THEN there SHALL be only one TemplateService implementation
6. WHEN analyzing agent management THEN there SHALL be no duplicate agent handling code
7. WHEN analyzing utility functions THEN there SHALL be no duplicate utility implementations
8. WHEN analyzing error handling THEN there SHALL be consolidated error handling patterns

### Requirement 2: Meaningful User Messages

**User Story:** As a user of the Docu extension, I want to receive clear, meaningful messages that tell me exactly what happened and what to do next so that I can effectively use the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing `/new "CardCraft Online Store PRD" --template basic --path docs/01-prd/` THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about document creation, file location, and next steps
2. WHEN a command succeeds THEN the system SHALL display success messages with actionable next steps
3. WHEN a command fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with recovery options
4. WHEN conversation features are available THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to use them
5. WHEN templates are applied THEN the system SHALL show template-specific information and guidance
6. WHEN files are created THEN the system SHALL show file path, size, and opening status
7. WHEN agents are involved THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which agent is active and what it can do

### Requirement 3: Consolidated Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer working on the extension, I want a clean, consolidated architecture with clear separation of concerns so that I can easily understand and modify the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the conversation system THEN there SHALL be a single ConversationManager with clear responsibilities
2. WHEN examining the output system THEN there SHALL be a single OutputCoordinator handling all command output
3. WHEN examining the command system THEN there SHALL be a single CommandRouter with no duplicate handlers
4. WHEN examining the template system THEN there SHALL be a single TemplateService with no duplicate logic
5. WHEN examining the agent system THEN there SHALL be a single AgentManager with consolidated functionality
6. WHEN examining utility functions THEN there SHALL be consolidated utilities with no duplication
7. WHEN examining error handling THEN there SHALL be a single error handling strategy
8. WHEN examining the extension entry point THEN there SHALL be clean initialization with no duplicate manager instances

### Requirement 4: Robust Message Flow

**User Story:** As a user executing commands, I want the message flow to be reliable and informative so that I always know the status of my operations and what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback about command parsing and validation
2. WHEN document creation starts THEN the system SHALL show progress and status updates
3. WHEN document creation completes THEN the system SHALL show success confirmation with file details
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error descriptions and recovery steps
5. WHEN conversation features are triggered THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what will happen next
6. WHEN templates are processed THEN the system SHALL show template application status and results
7. WHEN files are opened THEN the system SHALL confirm file opening and provide editing guidance
8. WHEN multiple feedback sources exist THEN the system SHALL coordinate them without duplication or conflicts

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user of the extension, I want fast, reliable command execution with consistent behavior so that I can work efficiently without encountering errors or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds for simple operations
2. WHEN creating documents THEN the system SHALL complete file creation within 5 seconds
3. WHEN multiple managers are involved THEN there SHALL be no race conditions or conflicts
4. WHEN the extension starts THEN there SHALL be no duplicate initialization or memory leaks
5. WHEN commands are executed repeatedly THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully without breaking subsequent operations
7. WHEN conversation features are used THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with command execution
8. WHEN output is rendered THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting messages displayed
