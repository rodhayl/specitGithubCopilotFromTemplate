# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Docu extension currently has a critical issue where commands like `/new` create documents and start conversations but fail to continue the conversation flow properly. Users execute commands that should initiate agent interactions, but the conversation stops after the initial command execution, requiring users to manually continue with additional messages. This breaks the seamless workflow that users expect from an AI-powered documentation assistant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Docu extension, I want commands like `/new` to seamlessly transition into agent conversations so that I can continue working on my document without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes `/new "Document Title" --template prd` THEN the system SHALL create the document AND automatically continue the conversation with the appropriate agent
2. WHEN a command starts a conversation context THEN the system SHALL immediately prompt for the first question AND wait for user response in the same conversation thread
3. WHEN a user responds to an agent question after a command THEN the system SHALL process the response and continue the conversation flow without requiring additional command invocation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all commands that initiate conversations to properly continue the conversation flow so that I don't have to manually restart conversations after command execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command executes `startContextGatheringConversation` THEN the system SHALL ensure the conversation continues beyond the initial question
2. WHEN a command completes successfully and starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL set the appropriate agent as active AND prepare for immediate user interaction
3. WHEN a conversation is started from a command THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation state until the user completes or explicitly ends the conversation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback about conversation state after command execution so that I understand what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the active agent and conversation state
2. WHEN a conversation is ready for user input THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to respond
3. WHEN a conversation fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and recovery instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent behavior across all commands that can initiate conversations so that the user experience is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command has the potential to start a conversation THEN it SHALL follow the same conversation initiation pattern
2. WHEN commands like `/new`, `/update`, `/review` start conversations THEN they SHALL all use the same conversation continuation mechanism
3. WHEN a command supports conversation flags (--with-conversation, --no-conversation) THEN the behavior SHALL be consistent across all commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversation flow to work properly in both online and offline modes so that I can use the extension regardless of AI service availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command starts a conversation in online mode THEN the system SHALL use the full AI-powered conversation manager
2. WHEN a command starts a conversation in offline mode THEN the system SHALL use the offline conversation fallback
3. WHEN switching between online and offline modes during a conversation THEN the system SHALL handle the transition gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the Docu extension, I want the codebase to be clean and free of duplicated or legacy code so that the conversation flow is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the conversation management code THEN the system SHALL have no duplicated conversation initialization logic
2. WHEN examining command handlers THEN there SHALL be no legacy conversation patterns that are no longer used
3. WHEN analyzing the conversation flow THEN all conversation-related functions SHALL follow a single, consistent pattern
4. WHEN checking for unused code THEN any obsolete conversation management functions SHALL be removed
5. WHEN validating the conversation system THEN there SHALL be clear separation between command execution and conversation continuation
