  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 9. Update other commands to use new conversation pattern



  - Update /update command handler for conversation continuation
  - Update /review command handler for conversation continuation
  - Update /templates command handler where applicable
  - Ensure consistent conversation behavior across all commands
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 10. Implement comprehensive testing for conversation flow




  - Create unit tests for ConversationContinuationManager
  - Create integration tests for command-to-conversation flow
  - Test conversation continuation in online and offline modes
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 11. Add conversation state feedback and user guidance





  - Implement clear conversation state indicators
  - Add instructions for users on how to continue conversations
  - Provide feedback when conversations are started from commands
  - Add fallback guidance when conversations fail to start
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 12. Remove all legacy code and duplicated code 
  - Find all duplicated code and legacy code that is related to the previous implementations
  - Check which is the option that we must use, make sure it is used and remove the rest
  - Validate the changes did not break the flow
  - Test the areas that were cleaned up
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [x] 13. Validate and optimize conversation flow performance
  - Test conversation initiation performance after commands
  - Ensure memory usage is optimized during conversation transitions
  - Validate that conversation state is properly maintained
  - Test concurrent conversation handling scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 4.1_
