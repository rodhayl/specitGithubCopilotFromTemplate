# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The extension is experiencing issues with command output duplication and inconsistent feedback display when executing commands like `/new`. Users are seeing repeated information, incomplete command execution, and confusing output formatting that makes it difficult to understand what actions were actually performed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want command outputs to be clean and non-duplicated, so that I can clearly understand what actions were performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes any command THEN the system SHALL display output only once without duplication
2. WHEN command execution completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear success or failure feedback
3. WHEN multiple feedback mechanisms exist THEN the system SHALL coordinate them to prevent duplicate messages
4. WHEN a command produces output THEN the system SHALL format it consistently and readably

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the `/new` command, I want the command to actually create documents and provide proper feedback, so that I can successfully create new documentation files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes `/new "title"` THEN the system SHALL create a new document with the specified title
2. WHEN document creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation with file path and next steps
3. WHEN document creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with recovery options
4. WHEN using template and path flags THEN the system SHALL respect those parameters and confirm their usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent command feedback formatting across all commands, so that I can easily parse and understand command results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command executes THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting for success messages
2. WHEN any command fails THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting for error messages
3. WHEN providing tips or guidance THEN the system SHALL format them distinctly from command results
4. WHEN showing progress indicators THEN the system SHALL use consistent visual elements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversation flow to integrate smoothly with command execution, so that there are no jarring transitions or duplicate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command triggers a conversation THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly without duplicate feedback
2. WHEN conversation handlers are not available THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback messaging
3. WHEN command completion guidance is shown THEN it SHALL not conflict with conversation feedback
4. WHEN multiple feedback systems are active THEN they SHALL coordinate to prevent information overlap
