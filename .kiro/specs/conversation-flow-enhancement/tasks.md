# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create ConversationSessionRouter component


  - Implement core session routing logic to determine if user input should go to conversation or agent

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Enhance ConversationManager with session tracking


  - Add getActiveSessionId() method to return current active session
  - Implement isSessionActive() to check session status

  - Add session metadata tracking for routing decisions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Update handleChatRequest to use conversation session routing


  - Modify the main chat handler to check for active conversation sessions before routing to agents
  - Integrate ConversationSessionRouter into the chat request flow
  - Ensure non-command messages are routed to active conversations when available
  - Remove old direct agent routing code that bypasses conversation sessions
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing agent routing for non-conversation scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Fix conversation continuation after command execution


  - Update ConversationFlowHandler to set active session when starting conversations
  - Ensure command results include conversation session information
  - Modify conversation initiation to properly register sessions with the router
  - Test that user responses after `/new` command are routed to conversation manager
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Implement conversation session state management


  - Create ConversationSessionState interface and implementation
  - Add session metadata tracking (agent, document path, template, timestamps)
  - Implement session cleanup when conversations end
  - Add session persistence for conversation recovery
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Create CommandTipProvider system for better user guidance


  - Implement CommandTipProvider interface with tip generation logic
  - Create tips for conversation-enabled commands with relevant examples
  - Add conversation-specific tips showing `/new --with-conversation` and `/chat` examples
  - Update command handlers to use the new tip system
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 7. Update command handlers to integrate with session routing


  - Modify handleNewCommand to set active conversation session when starting conversations
  - Update other conversation-capable commands to use session routing
  - Ensure command results include session information for proper routing
  - Add automatic conversation starting for commands with conversation flags
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Implement conversation error handling and recovery


  - Create ConversationErrorRecovery component for handling session errors
  - Add recovery logic for session not found and inactive session scenarios
  - Implement fallback options when conversation routing fails
  - Add clear error messages and recovery guidance for users
  - Remove any obsolete error handling code from previous implementations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive logging and debugging for conversation flow


  - Add detailed logging for conversation session routing decisions
  - Implement telemetry tracking for conversation flow success/failure
  - Add debug information for troubleshooting conversation issues
  - Create diagnostic commands for checking conversation state
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 10. Update tutorials and help documentation


  - Modify TUTORIAL_EXAMPLE.md to include current conversation flow examples
  - Update command help text to show accurate conversation examples
  - Add examples demonstrating both automatic and manual conversation starting
  - Update tips and guidance throughout the application
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 11. Create comprehensive tests for conversation session routing


  - Write unit tests for ConversationSessionRouter component
  - Create integration tests for end-to-end conversation flow after commands
  - Test conversation session state management and cleanup
  - Add tests for error handling and recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 12. Remove unused code and clean up legacy conversation patterns




  - Identify and remove any remaining legacy conversation initialization code
  - Clean up unused imports and dependencies related to old conversation patterns
  - Remove any dead code from previous conversation flow implementations
  - Consolidate duplicate conversation-related functions and interfaces
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 13. Validate and optimize conversation flow performance
  - Test conversation routing performance with multiple active sessions
  - Ensure memory usage is optimized for session state management
  - Validate that conversation continuity works across different scenarios
  - Test concurrent conversation handling and session isolation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_
-
 [x] 13. Fix compilation errors and finalize implementation
  - Fix TypeScript compilation errors in ConversationSessionRouter
  - Resolve duplicate function implementations
  - Fix Map constructor type issues
  - Update Agent interface usage to remove non-existent properties
  - Fix test file type errors and null assignments
  - Ensure all code compiles successfully
  - _Requirements: All requirements - ensure implementation is deployable_
