# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Docu extension is experiencing issues with offline mode detection and agent functionality. The extension incorrectly enters offline mode even when GitHub Copilot is available and authenticated, and agents fail to provide proper fallback functionality or start conversations as expected. This impacts user experience and makes the extension appear broken when it should be fully functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer with GitHub Copilot authenticated and working, I want the extension to operate in full online mode, so that I can access all AI-powered features without unnecessary limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Copilot is authenticated and available THEN the extension SHALL NOT enter offline mode
2. WHEN the extension checks model availability THEN it SHALL properly detect GitHub Copilot models
3. IF GitHub Copilot models are available THEN the extension SHALL operate in full online mode
4. WHEN the extension starts up THEN it SHALL display the correct mode status to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user running the `/new` command, I want agents to start interactive conversations and ask questions, so that I can create well-structured documents through guided assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `/new` with a template THEN the appropriate agent SHALL start an interactive conversation
2. WHEN an agent starts a conversation THEN it SHALL ask relevant questions for the document type
3. WHEN I respond to agent questions THEN the agent SHALL continue the conversation flow
4. WHEN the conversation completes THEN the agent SHALL update the document with gathered information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user in actual offline mode (no internet/Copilot unavailable), I want agents to provide meaningful fallback functionality, so that I can still create and work with documents effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is truly offline THEN agents SHALL provide structured fallback responses
2. WHEN agents cannot access AI features THEN they SHALL offer manual alternatives and guidance
3. WHEN creating documents offline THEN the extension SHALL use templates with helpful placeholders
4. WHEN agents are in offline mode THEN they SHALL clearly communicate available functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user following the tutorial, I want the documented commands and workflows to work as described, so that I can learn and use the extension effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following tutorial examples THEN all commands SHALL work as documented
2. WHEN the tutorial describes agent behavior THEN agents SHALL behave as described
3. WHEN the tutorial shows expected outputs THEN the extension SHALL produce similar outputs
4. WHEN tutorial steps are followed THEN users SHALL achieve the expected results
