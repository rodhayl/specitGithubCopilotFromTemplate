# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for fixing critical test failures in the VSCode documentation extension. The extension currently has 22 failing tests across security, error handling, command routing, tool management, and end-to-end workflow areas. These failures prevent reliable deployment and indicate potential runtime issues that could affect user experience.

The fixes must maintain backward compatibility while ensuring all tests pass and the extension functions correctly in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SecurityManager to properly sanitize user input, so that XSS attacks and malicious content are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SecurityManager receives input containing script tags THEN it SHALL remove the script tags while preserving the inner content
2. WHEN sanitizing `<script>alert("xss")</script>` THEN the system SHALL return `alert("xss")`
3. WHEN the sanitization method is called THEN it SHALL handle HTML entities and special characters correctly
4. WHEN malicious input is detected THEN the system SHALL log the sanitization action for security auditing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ErrorHandler tests to complete without timeouts, so that the test suite runs reliably and error categorization works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ErrorHandler tests run THEN they SHALL complete within the 2000ms timeout limit
2. WHEN testing file not found errors THEN the system SHALL properly categorize them as FileError type
3. WHEN testing permission errors THEN the system SHALL properly categorize them as PermissionError type
4. WHEN testing network errors THEN the system SHALL properly categorize them as NetworkError type
5. WHEN testing model errors THEN the system SHALL properly categorize them as ModelError type
6. WHEN testing workspace errors THEN the system SHALL handle VS Code dialog service interactions without blocking
7. WHEN testing template errors THEN the system SHALL properly categorize them as TemplateError type
8. WHEN testing generic errors THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback categorization
9. WHEN maintaining error history THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve error records correctly
10. WHEN providing error statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate accurate counts and percentages
11. WHEN limiting error history size THEN the system SHALL maintain the configured maximum number of entries
12. WHEN providing technical details THEN the system SHALL include relevant file paths and context information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CommandRouter to correctly identify valid commands while rejecting invalid ones, so that the chat participant responds appropriately to user input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CommandRouter receives a comment like "// this is a comment" THEN it SHALL NOT identify it as a command
2. WHEN the CommandRouter receives an empty command like "/" THEN it SHALL NOT identify it as a valid command
3. WHEN the CommandRouter receives valid slash commands THEN it SHALL identify them correctly
4. WHEN command identification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about why the input was rejected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ToolManager to execute tools successfully, so that file operations and template management work correctly in the extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing the listTemplates tool THEN it SHALL return success status and template data
2. WHEN executing listTemplates with agent filter THEN it SHALL return filtered results successfully
3. WHEN executing validateTemplate tool THEN it SHALL return validation results successfully
4. WHEN tool execution encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide descriptive error messages containing relevant context
5. WHEN executing openTemplate tool for built-in templates THEN it SHALL return success status and template content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end workflow tests to pass, so that the complete PRD creation, template management, and validation workflows function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the complete PRD creation workflow THEN it SHALL execute all steps successfully without errors
2. WHEN running the template management workflow THEN it SHALL create, list, and validate templates successfully
3. WHEN running the template creation and validation workflow THEN it SHALL handle the complete lifecycle without failures
4. WHEN workflow tests fail THEN they SHALL provide specific error information to aid debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper async/await handling in tests, so that asynchronous operations complete correctly and don't cause timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests involve asynchronous operations THEN they SHALL use proper async/await patterns
2. WHEN tests use promises THEN they SHALL ensure all promises resolve or reject appropriately
3. WHEN tests have callbacks THEN they SHALL call done() appropriately or return promises
4. WHEN async operations might take time THEN tests SHALL have appropriate timeout values

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper mocking and test isolation, so that tests don't interfere with each other and external dependencies are controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require VS Code APIs THEN they SHALL use appropriate mocks or test doubles
2. WHEN tests involve file system operations THEN they SHALL use isolated test environments
3. WHEN tests require external services THEN they SHALL mock those dependencies appropriately
4. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL clean up any created resources or state changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling in the test suite, so that test failures provide actionable debugging information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what went wrong
2. WHEN assertions fail THEN they SHALL show expected vs actual values clearly
3. WHEN setup or teardown fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific failure point
4. WHEN tests encounter unexpected errors THEN they SHALL capture and report the full error context

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to run consistently across different environments, so that CI/CD pipelines and local development produce reliable results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in different environments THEN they SHALL produce consistent results
2. WHEN tests depend on timing THEN they SHALL account for environment performance differences
3. WHEN tests use file paths THEN they SHALL work correctly on different operating systems
4. WHEN tests require specific VS Code versions THEN they SHALL verify compatibility appropriately
