# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project currently has critical compilation errors preventing successful builds, packaging, and testing. The errors span across missing test framework dependencies, TypeScript type mismatches, and duplicate function implementations. This feature will systematically resolve all compilation issues to restore the project to a working state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to compile and run successfully, so that I can validate code changes and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run test` THEN the system SHALL execute all tests without compilation errors
2. WHEN test files reference `expect` or `jest` functions THEN the system SHALL recognize these as valid testing framework functions
3. WHEN tests use Jest mocking capabilities THEN the system SHALL properly type and execute mock functions
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear test results and coverage information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript compilation to succeed without type errors, so that I can build and package the extension reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run compile` THEN the system SHALL complete compilation without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN TypeScript encounters type mismatches THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions and interfaces
3. WHEN arrays and objects are used THEN the system SHALL have explicit typing to avoid implicit 'any' types
4. WHEN function parameters are passed THEN the system SHALL match expected interface signatures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to package the extension successfully, so that I can distribute and deploy the VSCode extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run package` THEN the system SHALL create a valid .vsix package file
2. WHEN packaging occurs THEN the system SHALL include all necessary compiled assets
3. WHEN the package is created THEN the system SHALL validate the extension manifest and dependencies
4. WHEN packaging completes THEN the system SHALL produce no compilation or bundling errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate function implementations resolved, so that the codebase maintains clean architecture without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters duplicate function names THEN the system SHALL have only one implementation per function
2. WHEN functions are refactored THEN the system SHALL maintain all required functionality
3. WHEN duplicate code is removed THEN the system SHALL preserve the most complete and correct implementation
4. WHEN functions are consolidated THEN the system SHALL maintain proper TypeScript typing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Jest and testing framework configuration, so that the testing environment works seamlessly with TypeScript and VSCode extension development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest is configured THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript test files
2. WHEN tests import VSCode APIs THEN the system SHALL provide proper mocks and type definitions
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Jest presets for TypeScript compilation
4. WHEN test files are executed THEN the system SHALL have access to all necessary testing utilities and matchers
