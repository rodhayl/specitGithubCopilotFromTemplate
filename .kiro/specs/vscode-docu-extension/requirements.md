# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for building a Visual Studio Code extension that registers a chat participant (@docu) within GitHub Copilot Chat. The extension enables users to create, update, structure, and review Markdown documents within their workspace using specialized AI agents and slash commands, while leveraging VS Code's internal Language Model API without external API calls.

The extension follows a Kiro-inspired workflow starting with PRD creation, then moving through requirements gathering, design, and implementation phases.
