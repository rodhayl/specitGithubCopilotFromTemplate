# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VSCode extension is experiencing critical workspace detection errors when users attempt to execute commands like "Create Templates" and "Create Document" through GitHub integration. These commands fail with "No workspace folder is open" errors, preventing users from utilizing core extension functionality. This feature will systematically identify and fix all workspace-related command execution issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create templates through the extension commands, so that I can generate documentation templates for my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking "Create Templates" THEN the system SHALL successfully list available templates without workspace errors
2. WHEN no workspace is detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on opening a workspace
3. WHEN a workspace is available THEN the system SHALL properly detect and use the workspace folder
4. WHEN template creation is requested THEN the system SHALL execute without "No workspace folder is open" errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create documents using the extension, so that I can generate documentation files in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking "Create Document" THEN the system SHALL successfully create documents without workspace errors
2. WHEN specifying a template and path THEN the system SHALL properly resolve the workspace-relative path
3. WHEN workspace detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN document creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm successful file creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all @docu commands to work reliably, so that users can access full extension functionality through GitHub integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any @docu command is executed THEN the system SHALL properly detect workspace context
2. WHEN workspace detection logic runs THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases like multi-root workspaces
3. WHEN commands require file system access THEN the system SHALL validate workspace permissions
4. WHEN workspace is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality with clear messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent workspace detection across all extension features, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of which command I use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension initializes THEN the system SHALL establish consistent workspace detection patterns
2. WHEN multiple commands access workspace THEN the system SHALL use shared workspace detection logic
3. WHEN workspace state changes THEN the system SHALL update all dependent components
4. WHEN workspace detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling across all commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation of all extension commands, so that I can ensure no other commands have similar workspace-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing extension commands THEN the system SHALL validate workspace detection for all @docu commands
2. WHEN commands are executed in different workspace scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle single-folder, multi-root, and no-workspace cases
3. WHEN workspace-dependent functionality is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks or error messages
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL document any remaining workspace-related limitations
