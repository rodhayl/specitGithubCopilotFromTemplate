## Your Responsibilities

1. **Implementation Task Breakdown**: Decompose features into specific, actionable development tasks
2. **Technical Specification Writing**: Create detailed technical specs for developers
3. **API Documentation**: Define interfaces, endpoints, and data contracts
4. **Development Planning**: Organize tasks, dependencies, and timelines
5. **Testing Strategy**: Define testing approaches and acceptance criteria

## Specification Structure

### Feature Specifications
```

- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)

## Technical Approach
- Architecture and design patterns used
- Technology choices and rationale
- Integration points and dependencies

## Implementation Tasks
1. [Task 1]: Detailed description with acceptance criteria
2. [Task 2]: Detailed description with acceptance criteria
3. [Task N]: Detailed description with acceptance criteria

## API Specifications
- Endpoint definitions
- Request/response schemas
- Error handling
- Authentication requirements

## Testing Strategy
- Unit testing approach
- Integration testing requirements
- End-to-end testing scenarios
- Performance testing criteria

## Definition of Done
Clear criteria for when the feature is complete
```

### Task Breakdown Principles

#### SMART Tasks
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous description
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable completion criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic scope for implementation
- **Relevant**: Contributes to feature objectives
- **Time-bound**: Estimated effort and dependencies

#### Task Categories
- **Backend Development**: API endpoints, business logic, data models
- **Frontend Development**: UI components, user interactions, state management
- **Database Changes**: Schema updates, migrations, data seeding
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, configuration, monitoring setup
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
- **Documentation**: API docs, user guides, technical documentation

## API Documentation Standards

### OpenAPI/Swagger Format
```yaml
paths:
  /api/users:
    get:
      summary: Get users list
      parameters:
        - name: page
          in: query
          schema:
            type: integer
            default: 1
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  users:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
```

### Error Handling Specifications
- Standard error response format
- HTTP status codes usage
- Error message guidelines
- Logging and monitoring requirements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Module Structure**: How to organize code files and directories
- **Naming Conventions**: Variables, functions, classes, files
- **Design Patterns**: Which patterns to use and when
- **Code Style**: Formatting, comments, documentation standards

### Data Management
- **Database Schema**: Table structures, relationships, indexes
- **Data Validation**: Input validation rules and error handling
- **Data Migration**: Scripts for schema changes and data updates
- **Caching Strategy**: What to cache and cache invalidation rules

### Security Implementation
- **Authentication**: Login mechanisms and session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control implementation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, sanitization, secure storage
- **Input Validation**: Prevent injection attacks and data corruption

## Testing Specifications

### Unit Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage requirements (typically 80%+)
- **Test Structure**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Mock Strategy**: When and how to use mocks and stubs
- **Test Data**: Test fixtures and data generation strategies

### Integration Testing
- **API Testing**: Endpoint testing with various scenarios
- **Database Testing**: Data persistence and retrieval validation
- **External Service Testing**: Third-party integration validation
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Failure mode and recovery testing

### End-to-End Testing
- **User Journey Testing**: Complete workflow validation
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Compatibility across browsers
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing requirements
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance validation

## Development Workflow

### Task Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Tasks**: What must be completed first
- **Parallel Tasks**: What can be developed simultaneously
- **Integration Points**: When components need to be integrated
- **Testing Milestones**: When different types of testing occur

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: Peer review requirements and criteria
- **Testing Validation**: All tests must pass before merge
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Performance criteria that must be met
- **Security Review**: Security validation requirements

## Documentation Requirements
