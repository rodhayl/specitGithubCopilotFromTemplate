# Optimal AI Configuration for Cursor

## Philosophy

Cursor is built from the ground up as an AI-first code editor, leveraging advanced language models for intelligent code completion, generation, and refactoring. This configuration maximizes Cursor's native AI capabilities by establishing a structured workflow methodology inspired by specialized AI agents, creating a seamless development experience that combines human creativity with AI assistance.

The configuration emphasizes:
- **Contextual AI Interactions**: Leveraging Cursor's ability to understand entire codebases
- **Structured Workflows**: Implementing phase-based development approaches
- **Intelligent Code Generation**: Optimizing AI prompts for specific development tasks
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in review and validation processes

## Installation and Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. **Cursor Editor**: Download from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. **Active Subscription**: Cursor Pro recommended for advanced features
3. **Git Integration**: Ensure Git is installed and configured

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Install Cursor Extensions
```bash
# Open Cursor and install these essential extensions via the marketplace:
# - GitHub Copilot (if you have separate subscription)
# - GitLens
# - Error Lens
# - Prettier
# - ESLint
# - Thunder Client (for API testing)
```

#### 2. Apply Configuration Files
1. Copy all files from this directory to your project root
2. Restart Cursor to apply settings
3. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
4. Run "Cursor: Reload Window" to ensure all settings are active

#### 3. Initialize AI Workflow
1. Open `.cursor/prompts/` directory
2. Review and customize the agent prompts for your domain
3. Test the workflow by running the setup validation

#### 4. Verify Installation
Run the validation command in Cursor's terminal:
```bash
# Check if all configuration files are properly loaded
ls -la .cursor/
```

4. Iterate on the design with follow-up questions

## Advanced Features

### Custom Agent Creation
You can create custom agents by adding new prompt files to `.cursor/prompts/`:

```markdown
# .cursor/prompts/custom-agent.md
You are a specialized [ROLE] agent focused on [DOMAIN].

Your responsibilities:
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]

Always follow these principles:
- [Principle 1]
- [Principle 2]

When responding, structure your output as:
1. Analysis
2. Recommendations
3. Next Steps
```

### Workflow Automation
Cursor's AI can be configured to automatically trigger workflows based on file changes or git events. See `.cursor/workflows/` for examples.

### Integration with External Tools
The configuration includes integration points for:
- GitHub Actions
- Docker development environments
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment pipelines

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI Not Responding**
- Check your Cursor Pro subscription status
- Verify internet connection
- Restart Cursor and try again

**Prompts Not Loading**
- Ensure `.cursor/prompts/` directory exists
