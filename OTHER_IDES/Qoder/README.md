## Usage Examples

### AI-Powered Code Generation
```javascript
// Example: Generate a REST API endpoint
// Prompt: "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication with JWT tokens"

// Expected AI-generated code:
app.post('/api/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    const user = await User.findOne({ email });
    
    if (!user || !await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password)) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }
    
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    res.json({ token, user: { id: user._id, email: user.email } });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Server error' });
  }
});
```

### Automated Testing Generation
```javascript
// Example: Generate comprehensive tests for a function
// Prompt: "Generate unit tests for the user authentication function"

// Expected AI-generated tests:
describe('User Authentication', () => {
  test('should authenticate valid user', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('should reject invalid credentials', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('should handle server errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Code Review and Optimization
```javascript
// Example: AI-powered code review
// Prompt: "Review this code for security vulnerabilities and performance issues"

// AI provides analysis and suggestions:
// 1. Security: Add input validation for email and password
// 2. Performance: Consider caching user lookups
// 3. Error Handling: Improve error messages for better UX
```
