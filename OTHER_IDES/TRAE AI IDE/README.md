## Usage Examples

### AI-Powered Feature Development
```yaml
# Example workflow: Automated feature development
workflow:
  name: "feature-development"
  trigger: "user-request"
  steps:
    - agent: "product-planner"
      task: "analyze-requirements"
    - agent: "code-architect"
      task: "design-architecture"
    - agent: "implementation-engineer"
      task: "generate-code"
    - agent: "quality-assurance"
      task: "validate-implementation"
```

### Intelligent Code Generation
```python
# Example: AI-generated API endpoint
# Prompt: "Create a REST API for user management with CRUD operations"

# Expected AI-generated code:
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

@app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    users = User.query.all()
    return jsonify([{'id': u.id, 'username': u.username, 'email': u.email} for u in users])

@app.route('/api/users', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    user = User(username=data['username'], email=data['email'])
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'id': user.id, 'username': user.username, 'email': user.email}), 201
```

### Automated Testing Generation
```python
# Example: AI-generated comprehensive test suite
# Prompt: "Generate unit tests for the user management API"

import unittest
from app import app, db, User

class TestUserAPI(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.app = app.test_client()
        db.create_all()
    
    def tearDown(self):
        db.session.remove()
        db.drop_all()
    
    def test_get_users_empty(self):
        response = self.app.get('/api/users')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json, [])
    
    def test_create_user_success(self):
        user_data = {'username': 'testuser', 'email': 'test@example.com'}
        response = self.app.post('/api/users', json=user_data)
