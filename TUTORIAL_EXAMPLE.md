# Complete Tutorial: Building a Card Game Shop with Docu

This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to use all Docu agents in sequence to create complete documentation for a "Card Game Shop" project, from initial concept to implementation planning.

## Project Overview

We'll build documentation for **CardCraft**, an online card game shop that sells trading cards, board games, and gaming accessories. This tutorial will walk you through every command and agent interaction needed to create professional documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ VS Code 1.97.0 or higher
- ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot subscription and extension active
- ‚úÖ Docu extension installed and configured
- ‚úÖ A workspace folder open in VS Code

## Verification Setup

Let's verify everything is working before we begin:

```bash
# Test Docu is responding
@docu /help

# Check available agents
@docu /agent list

# Check available templates
@docu /templates list
```

If you see responses to these commands, you're ready to proceed!

## Phase 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD Creation)

### Step 1: Set the PRD Creator Agent

```bash
@docu /agent set prd-creator
```

**Expected Response:**
```
‚úÖ Switched to PRD Creator agent
üéØ I'm specialized in product concept exploration and PRD generation.
I'll help you think strategically about your product vision, objectives, and market positioning.
```

### Step 2: Create the Project Directory Structure

First, let's create the directory structure for our project:

```bash
# Create the main docs directory and subdirectories
mkdir -p docs/01-prd docs/02-requirements docs/03-architecture docs/04-implementation
```

Alternatively, you can create directories one at a time as needed, or let Docu create them automatically by omitting the path parameter.

### Step 2: Create the PRD Document

```bash
@docu /new "CardCraft Online Store PRD" --template prd --path docs/01-prd/
```

**What Happens:**
- Creates `docs/01-prd/cardcraft-online-store-prd.md`
- Automatically creates the directory structure if it doesn't exist
- Opens the document in VS Code
- Applies PRD template structure
- Shows clickable file link in chat

**If Template Variables Are Missing:**
If you see an error about missing required variables, Docu will provide helpful suggestions:
- Use the basic template instead: `--template basic`
- Check what variables are needed: `/templates show prd`
- The error message will show exactly which variables are missing and how to fix it

### Step 4: Engage with PRD Creator Agent

Now interact with the agent to develop your product concept:

**Your Input:**
