# Complete Tutorial: Building a Card Game Shop with Docu

This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to use all Docu agents in sequence to create complete documentation for a "Card Game Shop" project, from initial concept to implementation planning.

## Project Overview

We'll build documentation for **CardCraft**, an online card game shop that sells trading cards, board games, and gaming accessories. This tutorial will walk you through every command and agent interaction needed to create professional documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ VS Code 1.97.0 or higher
- ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot subscription and extension active
- ‚úÖ Docu extension installed and configured
- ‚úÖ A workspace folder open in VS Code

## üîÑ **Important: New Interaction Model**

Docu now uses an **explicit command-based interaction model** for better control:

- **‚ùå Old way:** `@docu some random message` (sent directly to AI)
- **‚úÖ New way:** `@docu /chat some message` (explicit conversation command)

**Why this change?**
- Prevents accidental AI calls from random messages
- Gives you full control over when AI features are used
- Makes the interaction model clear and predictable
- Allows for better offline mode handling

**Key Commands:**
- `/chat <message>` - Start conversations with the active agent
- `/agent set <name>` - Set the active agent before chatting
- `/new "Title"` - Create documents
- `/help` - Get help and see all commands

## Verification Setup

Let's verify everything is working before we begin:

```bash
# Test Docu is responding
@docu /help

# Check available agents
@docu /agent list

# Check available templates
@docu /templates list
```

**Expected Response for `/help`:**
```
ü§ñ **Docu Assistant Help**

Available commands:
‚Ä¢ /new <title> [--template <template-id>] [--path <output-path>] - Create a new document
‚Ä¢ /agent <subcommand> - Manage AI agents (list, set, current)
‚Ä¢ /templates <subcommand> - Manage templates (list, show, open)
‚Ä¢ /update <file> --section <section> - Update document sections
‚Ä¢ /review <file> [--level <level>] - Review document quality
```

**Expected Response for `/agent list`:**
```
üìã **Available Agents:**

‚Ä¢ **prd-creator** - Product Requirements Document creation and strategic planning
‚Ä¢ **brainstormer** - Creative ideation and concept exploration  
‚Ä¢ **requirements-gatherer** - Structured requirements collection using EARS format
‚Ä¢ **solution-architect** - Technical architecture and system design
‚Ä¢ **specification-writer** - Implementation planning and task breakdown
‚Ä¢ **quality-reviewer** - Document validation and quality assurance
```

**Expected Response for `/templates list`:**
```
üìÑ **Available Templates:**

‚Ä¢ **basic** - Basic document template with standard structure
‚Ä¢ **prd** - Product Requirements Document template
‚Ä¢ **requirements** - Requirements document with EARS format structure
```

If you see similar responses to these commands, you're ready to proceed!

## Phase 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD Creation)

### Step 1: Set the PRD Creator Agent

```bash
@docu /agent set prd-creator
```

**Expected Response:**
```
‚úÖ Switched to PRD Creator agent
üéØ I'm specialized in product concept exploration and PRD generation.
I'll help you think strategically about your product vision, objectives, and market positioning.
```

### Step 2: Create the Project Directory Structure
```

Let Docu create them automatically by omitting the path parameter.

### Step 2: Create the PRD Document

You have two main options for creating your PRD:

**Option A: Use Basic Template (Recommended for Beginners)**
```bash
@docu /new "CardCraft Online Store PRD" --template basic --path docs/01-prd/
```

**Option B: Use PRD Template (Advanced)**
```bash
@docu /new "CardCraft Online Store PRD" --template prd --path docs/01-prd/
```

**What Happens with Option A (Basic Template):**
- Creates `docs/01-prd/cardcraft-online-store-prd.md` with basic structure
- Creates the directory structure if it doesn't exist
- Opens the document in VS Code
- Works seamlessly with all agents for guided development
- No template variable requirements

**What Happens with Option B (PRD Template):**
- Attempts to create a structured PRD document
- May require specific template variables
- If variables are missing, you'll get helpful error messages with alternatives

**Expected Success Response:**
```
‚úÖ **Document Created Successfully**

üìÑ **File:** docs/01-prd/cardcraft-online-store-prd.md
üìÅ **Directory:** Created docs/01-prd/ 
üöÄ **Status:** Document opened in editor

**Next Steps:**
‚Ä¢ Work with the PRD Creator agent to develop your content
‚Ä¢ Use `/chat` commands to build out sections
‚Ä¢ The agent will guide you through strategic questions
```

**If You Get Template Variable Errors:**
```
‚ùå **Error creating document:** Missing required variables

**The PRD template requires specific variables. Here are your options:**

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Use placeholders that will be filled during conversation:
`/new "CardCraft Online Store PRD" --template prd --with-placeholders --path docs/01-prd/`

**Option 2:** Use the basic template and build structure through conversation:
`/new "CardCraft Online Store PRD" --template basic --path docs/01-prd/`

üí° *Both options work great with the PRD Creator agent for guided document creation*
```

@docu /new "Document Title" --template requirements --path docs/02-requirements/
@docu /new "Document Title" --template basic --path docs/03-architecture/

# Check template details if needed
@docu /templates show prd
@docu /templates show requirements
```

### Document Management Commands
```bash
# Document creation
@docu /new "Document Title" --template basic --path docs/folder/

# Agent-based document review (recommended)
# Use /chat commands with Quality Reviewer agent

# Template management
@docu /templates list
@docu /templates show basic
```

**Note:** Many advanced commands like `/update`, `/review`, `/catalog`, and `/summarize` may not be fully implemented yet. The recommended approach is to use `/chat` commands with the appropriate agents to achieve these goals.

### Template and Help Commands
```bash
@docu /templates list               # List available templates
@docu /templates show prd          # Show template details
@docu /help                        # General help
@docu /help new                    # Command-specific help

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Offline Mode Problems

**Issue: Extension shows "offline mode" even with GitHub Copilot working**

**Symptoms:**
- Docu reports being offline
- Agents provide basic templates instead of AI-powered responses
- Limited functionality available

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check current status
@docu /diagnostics

# Try switching agents to refresh connection
@docu /agent set prd-creator

# Restart VS Code if the issue persists
```

**Root Causes:**
- GitHub Copilot authentication interference
- Network connectivity issues
- Extension initialization problems

**Prevention:**
- Ensure GitHub Copilot is properly authenticated before using Docu
- Avoid running multiple AI extensions simultaneously during initial setup
- Keep VS Code and extensions updated

#### 2. GitHub Copilot Authentication Issues

**Issue: Docu causes GitHub Copilot to prompt for re-authentication**

**Symptoms:**
- GitHub Copilot stops working after using Docu
- Authentication prompts appear unexpectedly
- Both extensions show authentication errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart VS Code** - This often resolves authentication conflicts
2. **Re-authenticate GitHub Copilot:**
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Run "GitHub Copilot: Sign Out"
   - Run "GitHub Copilot: Sign In"
3. **Check extension compatibility:**
   - Ensure both extensions are updated to latest versions
   - Disable other AI extensions temporarily

**Prevention:**
- Authenticate GitHub Copilot before installing Docu
- Avoid rapid switching between AI features
- Use one AI extension at a time when possible

#### 3. Template and Command Issues

**Issue: Template variable errors when creating documents**

**Error Message:**
```
‚ùå Error creating document: Missing required variables
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use basic template instead
@docu /new "Document Title" --template basic

# Check template requirements
@docu /templates show prd

# Use placeholders if supported
@docu /new "Document Title" --template prd --with-placeholders
```

**Issue: Commands not recognized or not working**

**Symptoms:**
- Commands return "not implemented" messages
- Unexpected error responses
- Features described in tutorial don't work

**Solutions:**
1. **Check available commands:**
   ```bash
   @docu /help
   ```
2. **Use `/chat` command instead:**
   - Instead of `/review --file document.md`
   - Use: `@docu /chat Please review my document at document.md`
3. **Verify agent capabilities:**
   ```bash
   @docu /agent list
   @docu /agent current
   ```

#### 4. Agent and Conversation Issues

**Issue: Agents not responding or providing generic responses**

**Symptoms:**
- Agents give the same response regardless of input
- No personalized or contextual responses
- Conversations don't progress naturally

**Solutions:**
1. **Check online status:**
   - Verify GitHub Copilot is working in other contexts
   - Try switching agents: `@docu /agent set prd-creator`
2. **Restart conversation:**
   - Switch to a different agent and back
   - Restart VS Code if needed
3. **Use specific prompts:**
   - Be detailed in your requests
   - Provide context about your project
   - Ask specific questions rather than general ones

**Issue: Agent switching doesn't work**

**Error Message:**
```
‚ùå Failed to switch to agent: [agent-name]
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check available agents
@docu /agent list

# Verify correct agent name
@docu /agent set prd-creator
@docu /agent set requirements-gatherer
@docu /agent set solution-architect
```

#### 5. File and Workspace Issues

**Issue: Documents not created in expected locations**

**Symptoms:**
- Files created in wrong directories
- Path errors when specifying locations
- Permission denied errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Ensure workspace is open:**
   - Open a folder in VS Code before using Docu
   - Use File ‚Üí Open Folder to select project directory
2. **Use relative paths:**
   ```bash
   @docu /new "Document" --path docs/
   @docu /new "Document" --path ./docs/requirements/
   ```
3. **Check workspace permissions:**
   - Ensure you have write permissions to the workspace
   - Avoid system directories or protected folders

#### 6. Performance and Responsiveness Issues

**Issue: Slow responses or timeouts**

**Symptoms:**
- Long delays before agent responses
- Timeout errors
- VS Code becomes unresponsive

**Solutions:**
1. **Check network connection:**
   - Ensure stable internet connectivity
   - Test GitHub Copilot in other contexts
2. **Reduce complexity:**
   - Break large requests into smaller parts
   - Focus on one section at a time
3. **Restart if needed:**
   - Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"
   - Close and reopen VS Code completely

### Debugging Steps

#### Step 1: Basic Diagnostics
```bash
# Check system status
@docu /help
@docu /agent list
@docu /templates list

# Verify workspace
# Ensure a folder is open in VS Code
```

#### Step 2: Test Core Functionality
```bash
# Test document creation
@docu /new "Test Document" --template basic

# Test agent switching
@docu /agent set prd-creator
@docu /agent current
```

#### Step 3: Check GitHub Copilot Integration
1. Test GitHub Copilot independently:
   - Open a code file
   - Try getting code suggestions
   - Verify Copilot chat works
2. If Copilot has issues, resolve those first before using Docu

#### Step 4: Advanced Troubleshooting
1. **Check VS Code logs:**
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Run "Developer: Toggle Developer Tools"
   - Check Console for errors
2. **Extension conflicts:**
   - Disable other AI extensions temporarily
   - Test Docu functionality
   - Re-enable extensions one by one
