# Agent Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information about Docu's AI agents, their capabilities, and how to use them effectively in your documentation workflow.

## Overview

Docu includes six specialized AI agents, each designed for specific phases of the documentation workflow. These agents follow a Kiro-inspired methodology, progressing from initial product concepts to detailed implementation specifications.

## Agent Architecture

### Agent Phases

The agents are organized into four main workflow phases:

1. **PRD Phase** - Product concept and strategic planning
2. **Requirements Phase** - Detailed business requirements gathering  
3. **Design Phase** - Technical architecture and solution design
4. **Implementation Phase** - Specifications and quality assurance

### Agent Capabilities

Each agent has:
- **Specialized System Prompts** - Tailored for their specific role
- **Tool Access** - Restricted to relevant tools for their phase
- **Template Restrictions** - Can only use appropriate templates
- **Context Awareness** - Builds upon previous agents' outputs

@docu /agent set <agent-name>

# Check current agent
@docu /agent current
```

### Agent Context

Agents maintain context across interactions:
- **Previous Outputs** - Reference earlier documents
- **Workflow State** - Track current phase
- **User Preferences** - Remember settings
- **Project Context** - Understand project scope

### Agent Collaboration

Agents are designed to work together:

1. **Sequential Workflow** - Each agent builds on previous work
2. **Context Sharing** - Agents reference previous outputs
3. **Phase Transitions** - Natural progression through workflow
4. **Quality Gates** - Review points between phases

## Workflow Examples

### Complete Documentation Workflow

```bash
# Phase 1: PRD Creation
@docu /agent set prd-creator
@docu /new "E-commerce Platform PRD" --template prd

# Phase 1: Ideation
@docu /agent set brainstormer
# Engage in conversation about features and innovations

# Phase 2: Requirements
@docu /agent set requirements-gatherer
@docu /new "E-commerce Requirements" --template requirements

# Phase 3: Design
@docu /agent set solution-architect
@docu /new "E-commerce Architecture" --template basic

# Phase 4: Implementation
@docu /agent set specification-writer
@docu /new "E-commerce Implementation Plan" --template basic

# Phase 4: Quality Assurance
@docu /agent set quality-reviewer
@docu /review --file requirements.md --level strict
@docu /review --file architecture.md --level normal
```

### Iterative Refinement

```bash
# Start with requirements
@docu /agent set requirements-gatherer
@docu /new "API Requirements" --template requirements

# Review and refine
@docu /agent set quality-reviewer
@docu /review --file api-requirements.md --level normal

# Back to requirements for updates
@docu /agent set requirements-gatherer
@docu /update --file api-requirements.md --section "Authentication" "Updated auth requirements"

# Final review
@docu /agent set quality-reviewer
@docu /review --file api-requirements.md --level strict --fix
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection

1. **Follow the Workflow** - Use agents in their intended phase order
2. **Match Purpose** - Choose agents based on your current task
3. **Consider Context** - Agents work best with relevant context
4. **Iterate as Needed** - Switch back to previous agents for refinement

### Effective Interactions

1. **Be Specific** - Provide clear context and requirements
2. **Use Templates** - Leverage appropriate templates for structure
3. **Build Incrementally** - Work through phases systematically
4. **Review Regularly** - Use Quality Reviewer for validation

### Context Management

1. **Reference Previous Work** - Agents can access earlier documents
2. **Maintain Consistency** - Keep terminology and concepts aligned
3. **Document Decisions** - Record important choices and rationale
4. **Track Progress** - Monitor workflow phase progression

## Customization

### Agent Configuration

Agents can be customized through configuration files in `.vscode/docu/agents/`:

```yaml
# .vscode/docu/agents/custom-requirements.yaml
name: custom-requirements-gatherer
description: Custom requirements gatherer for our methodology
phase: requirements
systemPrompt: |
  You are a specialized requirements analyst for enterprise software.
  Focus on compliance, security, and scalability requirements.
  Use our internal requirements template format.
allowedTools:
  - readFile
  - writeFile
  - applyTemplate
  - insertSection
workflowPhase: requirements
```

### Template Restrictions

Control which templates agents can use:

```yaml
# In template definition
agentRestrictions:
  - requirements-gatherer
  - quality-reviewer
```

### System Prompt Customization

Modify agent behavior through system prompts:

```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a {agentName} specialized in {domain}.
  Your role is to {primaryFunction}.
  
  Key responsibilities:
  - {responsibility1}
  - {responsibility2}
  
  Always follow {methodology} methodology.
  Ensure outputs are {qualityStandard} compliant.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding

1. Check agent is properly set: `@docu /agent current`
2. Verify GitHub Copilot is authenticated
3. Check extension output for errors
4. Try switching agents and back

### Context Issues

1. Ensure previous documents are accessible
2. Check workspace folder structure
3. Verify file permissions
4. Review agent configuration

### Template Restrictions

1. Check template agent restrictions
2. Verify agent has access to required templates
3. Use `/templates list --agent <name>` to see available templates

### Performance Issues

1. Check system resources
2. Review log files for bottlenecks
3. Consider reducing context size
4. Enable performance telemetry

## Advanced Features

### Agent Hooks

Create automated workflows with agent hooks:

```json
{
  "trigger": "file.saved",
  "pattern": "*requirements*.md",
  "agent": "quality-reviewer",
  "action": "review --level normal"
}
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Define complex workflows with multiple agents:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: complete-feature-spec
  phases:
    - agent: prd-creator
      template: prd
      output: feature-prd.md
    - agent: requirements-gatherer
      template: requirements
      input: feature-prd.md
      output: feature-requirements.md
    - agent: solution-architect
      template: basic
      input: feature-requirements.md
      output: feature-architecture.md
```

### Agent Analytics

Monitor agent usage and effectiveness:

```bash
# View agent usage statistics
@docu /diagnostics --section agents

# Export agent performance data
@docu /export --type agent-analytics
```
