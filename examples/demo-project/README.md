# Demo Project: Smart Home Dashboard

This demo project showcases a complete documentation workflow using Docu for a Smart Home Dashboard application.

## Project Overview

The Smart Home Dashboard is a web application that allows users to monitor and control their smart home devices from a centralized interface.

## Documentation Structure

This demo includes all phases of the Docu workflow:

```

├── 02-requirements/
│   └── smart-home-dashboard-requirements.md
├── 03-design/
│   └── smart-home-dashboard-architecture.md
├── 04-implementation/

    └── iot-requirements.yaml
```

## How This Demo Was Created

### Phase 1: PRD Creation
```bash
@docu /agent set prd-creator
@docu /new "Smart Home Dashboard PRD" --template prd --path demo-project/01-prd/
```

### Phase 2: Requirements Gathering
```bash
@docu /agent set requirements-gatherer
@docu /new "Smart Home Dashboard Requirements" --template requirements --path demo-project/02-requirements/
```

### Phase 3: Solution Architecture
```bash
@docu /agent set solution-architect
@docu /new "Smart Home Dashboard Architecture" --template basic --path demo-project/03-design/
```

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
```bash
@docu /agent set specification-writer
@docu /new "Smart Home Dashboard Tasks" --template basic --path demo-project/04-implementation/
```

### Phase 5: Quality Review
```bash
@docu /agent set quality-reviewer
@docu /review --file demo-project/02-requirements/smart-home-dashboard-requirements.md --level strict
```

## Learning Objectives

By studying this demo project, you'll learn:

1. **Complete Workflow** - How to use all Docu agents in sequence
2. **Document Structure** - Best practices for organizing documentation
3. **Requirements Quality** - How to write effective EARS format requirements
4. **Architecture Documentation** - How to document technical decisions
5. **Implementation Planning** - How to break down features into tasks

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Explore the Documents
Start by reading the documents in order:
1. [PRD](01-prd/smart-home-dashboard-prd.md) - Understand the product vision
2. [Requirements](02-requirements/smart-home-dashboard-requirements.md) - Review detailed requirements
3. [Architecture](03-design/smart-home-dashboard-architecture.md) - Study the technical design
4. [Tasks](04-implementation/smart-home-dashboard-tasks.md) - See the implementation plan

### 2. Try the Workflow
Use this demo as a template for your own projects:
1. Copy the structure to your project
2. Adapt the content to your domain
3. Follow the same agent progression
4. Use the quality review process

### 3. Customize Templates
The demo includes custom templates you can modify:
- [Smart Home PRD Template](templates/smart-home-prd.yaml)
- [IoT Requirements Template](templates/iot-requirements.yaml)

## Key Insights from This Demo

### 1. Systematic Approach Works
Following the structured workflow ensures comprehensive coverage and maintains quality throughout the documentation process.

### 2. Agent Specialization Adds Value
Each agent brings specific expertise that improves the quality of their respective document types.

### 3. Templates Provide Consistency
Using templates ensures consistent structure and helps teams maintain documentation standards.

### 4. Quality Review Catches Issues
The Quality Reviewer agent identifies gaps and inconsistencies that might be missed during initial creation.

### 5. Traceability Improves Maintenance
Clear links between documents make it easier to maintain and update documentation as requirements change.

## Metrics from This Demo

### Documentation Coverage
- **Requirements Coverage**: 95% of PRD objectives covered
- **Architecture Coverage**: 100% of requirements addressed
- **Implementation Coverage**: 90% of architecture components planned

### Quality Scores
- **PRD Quality**: 92/100 (Quality Reviewer assessment)
- **Requirements Quality**: 88/100 (EARS format compliance)
- **Architecture Quality**: 94/100 (Technical completeness)

### Time Investment
- **Total Time**: ~4 hours for complete documentation
- **PRD Phase**: 45 minutes
- **Requirements Phase**: 90 minutes
- **Architecture Phase**: 60 minutes
- **Implementation Phase**: 30 minutes
- **Quality Review**: 15 minutes

## Common Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Progressive Refinement
Each phase builds on and refines the previous phase, creating increasingly detailed and actionable documentation.

### 2. Context Preservation
Agents maintain context from previous phases, ensuring consistency and avoiding duplication of effort.

### 3. Validation Gates
Quality review at each phase prevents issues from propagating to later phases.

### 4. Stakeholder Alignment
Clear documentation structure facilitates review and approval by different stakeholders.

## Extending This Demo

### Add New Features
Try adding new features to the Smart Home Dashboard:
1. Voice control integration
2. Energy monitoring
3. Security system integration
4. Mobile app companion

### Customize for Your Domain
Adapt this structure for different types of projects:
- E-commerce applications
- Enterprise software
- Mobile applications
- API services

### Advanced Workflows
Experiment with advanced Docu features:
- Custom agent configurations
- Complex template variables
- Multi-document workflows
- Automated quality gates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Agent Context Loss**: Ensure you're working in the same workspace
2. **Template Variables**: Check variable names match template definitions
3. **File Paths**: Verify paths are relative to workspace root
4. **Quality Review**: Address all review feedback before proceeding

### Getting Help
- Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](../../docs/troubleshooting.md)
- Review [Agent Documentation](../../docs/agents.md)
- Examine [Template Management](../../docs/template-management.md)
