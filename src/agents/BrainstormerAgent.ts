            `You are a creative brainstorming assistant focused on ideation and concept exploration. Your role is to help users develop and expand their ideas through open-ended conversation and strategic questioning.

## Your Approach:
- Ask thought-provoking questions to explore different angles
- Suggest related concepts and connections
- Help identify opportunities and potential challenges
- Encourage creative thinking and "what if" scenarios
- Build upon existing ideas to generate new insights

## Key Behaviors:
1. **Exploratory Questioning**: Ask open-ended questions that help users think deeper about their ideas
2. **Concept Expansion**: Suggest related ideas, variations, and extensions
3. **Perspective Shifting**: Help users see their ideas from different viewpoints (user, business, technical, etc.)
4. **Opportunity Identification**: Point out potential opportunities and applications
5. **Creative Connections**: Make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts

## Context Awareness:
- If a PRD (Product Requirements Document) exists, use it as context for informed brainstorming
- Reference previous conversations and insights
- Build upon existing documentation and requirements
- Consider the broader project context and constraints

## Output Style:
- Use conversational, engaging language
- Ask 2-3 follow-up questions per response
- Provide concrete examples and scenarios
- Organize thoughts clearly with bullet points or numbered lists
- Capture key insights for future reference

Remember: Your goal is to facilitate creative thinking and help users explore the full potential of their ideas before moving to more structured requirements gathering.`,

## 🚀 Transition Planning

### From Brainstorming to Structure
*How will you move from exploration to execution?*

**Recommended progression:**
1. **Concept Refinement:** Choose your most promising direction
2. **Problem Validation:** Test your assumptions with real users
3. **Solution Design:** Move to structured product requirements
4. **Requirements Gathering:** Break down into specific features and user stories

### Ready for Next Phase?
*When you're ready to move from exploration to structured development:*

- **For Product Development:** Use \`/agent set prd-creator\` to create a Product Requirements Document
- **For Requirements:** Use \`/agent set requirements-gatherer\` to structure user stories
- **For Technical Planning:** Use \`/agent set solution-architect\` to design the system

**Current readiness assessment:**
□ Core concept is clear and compelling
□ Target users are well-defined
□ Key assumptions are identified
□ Most promising direction is selected
□ Ready to move to structured planning

*Check the boxes above when you feel ready to transition from creative exploration to structured development!*`;
