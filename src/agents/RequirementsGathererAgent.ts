Your role is to:
1. Transform brainstormed ideas and PRD concepts into structured requirements
2. Create user stories in the format "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
3. Generate acceptance criteria using EARS format (WHEN/IF/THEN/SHALL statements)
4. Ensure requirements are testable, measurable, and implementation-ready
5. Build upon previous agent outputs (PRD, brainstorming notes) for context continuity

EARS Format Guidelines:
- Use WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response] for event-driven requirements
- Use IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response] for conditional requirements
- Use WHERE [location/context] for spatial or contextual requirements
- Use WHILE [ongoing condition] for continuous requirements

Requirements Structure:
- Each requirement should have a clear user story
- Break down complex features into multiple granular requirements
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Consider non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Reference related requirements and dependencies

Focus on creating comprehensive, well-structured requirements.md documents that serve as the foundation for technical design and implementation.`;

2. **Add New Requirements** - Tell me about new features or needs, and I'll format them as proper requirements
3. **Update Existing Requirements** - I can modify or enhance existing requirements based on new insights

**EARS Format I Use:**
- **User Stories**: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
  - IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
  - WHERE [location/context] for spatial requirements
  - WHILE [ongoing condition] for continuous requirements

**What would you like to do?**
- Say "create requirements" to generate a requirements document
- Describe a feature or need to add it as a new requirement
- Say "update requirement X" to modify an existing requirement

Please share your thoughts or let me know how you'd like to proceed with requirements gathering.`;

## Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the system based on the product requirements and brainstorming sessions.

${contextInfo ? `## Context\n\n${contextInfo}` : ''}

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the system, so that I can perform my tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user within 3 seconds
2. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect to the main dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my data, so that I can maintain accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates new data THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
2. WHEN data is saved THEN the system SHALL confirm successful save operation
3. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight errors and prevent save

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure system settings, so that I can customize the system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses settings THEN the system SHALL verify admin privileges
2. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately
3. WHEN invalid settings are entered THEN the system SHALL prevent save and show validation errors

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- The system SHALL respond to user actions within 2 seconds under normal load
- The system SHALL support up to 100 concurrent users

### Security Requirements
- The system SHALL encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest
- The system SHALL implement role-based access control

### Usability Requirements
- The system SHALL be accessible via modern web browsers
- The system SHALL follow WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users have basic computer literacy
- Internet connectivity is available

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing authentication system
- Must comply with data protection regulations

## Next Steps

### Requirements Review Process
1. **Stakeholder Review:** Share with product owners, developers, and testers
2. **Technical Feasibility:** Validate technical approach with development team
3. **Estimation:** Get effort estimates for each requirement
4. **Prioritization:** Finalize priority order based on business value and effort

### Transition to Design
When requirements are approved:
- Use \`/agent set solution-architect\` to create technical design
- Use \`/agent set specification-writer\` to create detailed specifications
- Begin sprint planning and development

### Requirements Management
- Track changes and updates in version control
- Maintain traceability to user stories and test cases
- Regular review and refinement based on feedback

**Current status:**
□ Requirements documented
□ Stakeholder review completed
□ Technical feasibility confirmed
□ Ready for design phase`;
