# Test Script: Agent Conversation Follow-up Fix

## Quick Test Sequence

### 1. Test PRD Creator Agent Conversation
```bash
# Set the PRD Creator agent
@docu /agent set prd-creator

# Start a conversation (should get initial question)
@docu /chat Help me develop a PRD for my card game shop

# Respond to the agent's question (should get follow-up)
@docu /chat I want to solve the problem of card game enthusiasts not being able to find authentic, competitively priced cards in one place

# Continue the conversation (should get more questions and document updates)
@docu /chat My target users are competitive card game players aged 16-35 who participate in tournaments and need reliable access to specific cards
```

### 2. Expected Behavior After Fix

**First Response (@docu /chat Help me develop...):**
- Agent should ask a specific strategic question about your product
- Should provide examples and context
- Should offer follow-up suggestions

**Second Response (after describing problem):**
- Agent should acknowledge your response
- Should ask a follow-up question about users, solution, or success metrics
- Should indicate document content is being captured

**Third Response (after describing users):**
- Agent should continue with next logical question
- Should show progress in conversation
- Document should start getting populated with your responses

### 3. What to Look For

✅ **Working Correctly:**
- Agent asks specific, contextual questions
- Each response leads to a relevant follow-up question
- Agent acknowledges and builds on your previous answers
- Document gets created and populated automatically
- Conversation flows naturally toward completion

❌ **Still Broken:**
- Agent gives generic responses regardless of input
- Same question repeated or no follow-up questions
- No document content generation
- Conversation doesn't progress or build context

### 4. Troubleshooting

If agents still aren't following up properly:

1. **Check Extension Logs:**
   - Open VS Code Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - Look for conversation manager errors in console

2. **Verify Agent Status:**
   ```bash
   @docu /agent current
   @docu /help
   ```

3. **Try Different Agent:**
   ```bash
   @docu /agent set brainstormer
   @docu /chat What innovative features could make my product stand out?
   ```

### 5. Success Indicators

The fix is working if:
- Agents ask 4-6 strategic questions in sequence
- Each question builds on previous responses
- Document sections get populated automatically
- Conversation feels natural and purposeful
- Agent suggests next steps or phase transitions

### 6. Report Results

Please test this sequence and let me know:
- Which responses work as expected
- Where the conversation breaks down (if it does)
- Any error messages you see
- Whether documents get populated with content

This will help me identify if additional fixes are needed.
