# Test Conversation Integration

## Summary

I have successfully implemented task 2 "Enhance agent conversation integration with /new command" with the following improvements:

### Task 2.1: Modify handleNewCommand to trigger conversations ✅

**Changes made:**
1. **Added `shouldStartConversation` function** - Determines when to start conversations based on:
   - Explicit flags (`--with-conversation`, `--no-conversation`)
   - Template type (PRD, requirements, design, specification)
   - Placeholder usage (`--with-placeholders`)

2. **Enhanced conversation triggering logic** - Modified the `/new` command to:
   - Check for conversation appropriateness
   - Support both online and offline modes
   - Provide fallback options when AI is unavailable

3. **Improved template integration** - Templates now automatically trigger conversations when:
   - Using structured templates (PRD, requirements, etc.)
   - Using placeholders flag
   - Explicitly requested via flags

### Task 2.2: Implement conversation flow management ✅

**Changes made:**
1. **Enhanced session management** - Added support for:
   - Online conversation sessions via ConversationManager
   - Offline session tracking via extension state
   - Document path storage for session continuity

2. **Improved question progression** - Implemented:
   - `moveToNextContextQuestion` with offline support
   - `showOnlineQuestion` for interactive AI conversations
   - `showOfflineQuestion` for manual input collection

3. **Document update logic** - Created:
   - `generateDocumentFromContext` with online/offline modes
   - `handleOfflineDocumentGeneration` for manual workflows
   - `updateDocumentWithOfflineContent` for structured content creation

4. **Conversation completion** - Added:
   - Automatic document generation when conversations complete
   - Offline response collection and storage
   - Graceful fallback when AI features fail

### Key Features Implemented

#### Online Mode (AI Available)
- Interactive conversation flows with agents
- Real-time question progression
- AI-powered document generation
- Automatic content updates

#### Offline Mode (AI Unavailable)
- Manual question progression with input dialogs
- Structured guidance and examples
- Response collection and storage
- Manual document editing workflows

#### Hybrid Mode (Fallback Support)
- Automatic detection of AI availability
- Graceful degradation to offline mode
- Seamless transition between modes
- Preserved conversation state

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 2.1**: `/new` command now triggers agent conversations appropriately
✅ **Requirement 2.2**: Conversation flows work for document creation
✅ **Requirement 2.3**: Proper conversation state management implemented
✅ **Requirement 2.4**: Conversations work in both online and offline modes

### Technical Implementation

The implementation includes:
- 8 new functions for conversation management
- Enhanced offline mode support
- Improved error handling and fallbacks
- Session state persistence
- Document path tracking
- Response collection and storage

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing code patterns and architecture.
